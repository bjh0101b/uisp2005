Micro In-System Programmer Brief Installation Notes

Enter the src directory.

If uisp does not compile successfully, add switch -DNO_DIRECT_IO in the
Makefile to remove support for direct I/O port access (that may be
necessary on non-PC architectures).  Parallel port access should still
work if you have the Linux ppdev driver (patch for 2.2.17 is in the
kernel directory, ppdev is standard in 2.4 kernels).  Please lobby
Alan Cox to include this tiny little driver in 2.2.x too :).

To make it type:

	make

and to install it:

	make install
